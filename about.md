I have over 10 years of experience, working in different organizations as a Senior Developer and team lead.

I was involved in 6+ major projects in the last 4 years, varying from European Union Regulatory Software to Internet Banking solution and High Frequency Trading Server.

Over the last years I have contributed to several [opensource projects](https://github.com/esarbanis) in the java and js ecosystem.
